Hi everyone, welcome to my blog, I'm a blockchain researcher, I have been working in this role for over 4 years. In this blog, I write about blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and other related topics.

## The journey into blockchain technology.
I started my journey into blockchain in 2019 when I was in my secondary year of university. I was studying computer science and I was looking for a topic for deeply researching. I came across blockchain and I was immediately fascinated by it. I started reading everything I could find about blockchain and cryptocurrencies and I knew that this was what I wanted to do.

1 year later, I started working as a blockchain developer at a startup. I was working on a project that was using blockchain technology to allow people tracing the origin of products. It was a great experience and I learned a lot.

Since 2021, I left my first job and started working as a blockchain researcher at Ninety Eight (formerly Coin98). I have been working in this role for over 3 years. Over the past three years, I have been actively involved in a range of projects focused on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, deepening my expertise in this rapidly evolving field.

## Side projects.
I have also found a few side projects related to blockchain technology. I have created a few smart contracts and decentralized applications.

### Abstraction Wallet

Abstraction Wallet is account abstraction wallet combine with passkey technology. Which allows user to interact with the blockchain in a simple and intuitive way. They can create their wallet without remembering any private key or mnemonic phrase. 

Abstraction started with one core mission: to build intuitive smart wallets for the future of decentralized. I believe that the future of blockchain is decentralized and that everyone should have access to the tools they need to interact with the blockchain. After 2 months of hard work and innovation,I released a Proof of Concept (PoC), marking a significant milestone in the projectâ€™s development

Abstraction Wallet, available at [wallet.abstraction.world](https://wallet.abstraction.world), offers users a secure wallet with a user-friendly interface that allows them to interact with the blockchain in a simple and intuitive way.

## Why I started this blog.
I was inspired to start this blog because I wanted to share my knowledge and experience with others. And this blog also helps me learn new things. I hope you enjoy reading my blog and find it helpful.
