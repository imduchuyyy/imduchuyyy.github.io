# zk-SNARK overview
Zk-SNARK is an acronym that stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge.” A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof that allows one party to prove it possesses certain information without revealing that information.
This proof is made possible using a secret key created before the transaction takes place. It is used as part of the protocol for the cryptocurrency ([ZCash](https://z.cash/))

## Key takeaways
> zk-SNARK is Zero-Knowledge proof protocol used in encryption, and is and acronym that stands for "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge". 
> This proof was first developed and introduced in the late 1980s, and is now employed by the cryptocurrency Zcash and Mina protocol to solve a perceived anonymity problem with Bitcoin-type blockchains.
